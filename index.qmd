## Overview

Welcome to the supplementary repository for our presentation at **CONVENTION A \| ASIA**.

This project demonstrates the application of **Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID)**, a novel approach in Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) designed to bridge the gap between high-performance "black-box" models and the transparency requirements of actuarial practice.

### Key Topics of the Presentation

-   **Theoretical Foundation**: Understanding the decomposition of complex models into interpretable main effects and interaction components.
-   **Actuarial Application**: Benchmarking MID using the industry-standard `freMTPL2freq` dataset.
-   **Multi-Language Software**: Hands-on demonstrations using `midr` (R) and `midlearn` (Python).

## Project Structure

This Quarto website contains the following sections:

1.  [**Preprocessing**](./notebooks/preprocessing.html): Data cleaning and feature engineering of the French Motor Third-Party Liability dataset.
2.  [**R Demo (midr)**](./notebooks/demo_midr.html): A demonstration of the `midr` package.
3.  [**Python Demo (midlearn)**]: A demonstration of the `midlearn` package, providing a seamless interface for Python users.

## Methodology: What is MID?

Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID) allows actuaries to extract "smooth" and interpretable rating factors from complex models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

Unlike traditional GLMs, MID captures non-linearities and interactions automatically while maintaining the clarity of traditional actuarial pricing tables.
